## My process

### Built with
- vanilla css

### What I learned
- Both `section` and `article` HTML elements are very suitable for (header + paragraph) combination.
  While `section` is more generic, `article` is better for atomic elements.
- You can style the list item indicator (style, size, ...) by styling `li` and its `span` stuff separately.
- To change padding of `li` elements, you'd probably need to use `list-style-position: inside` first.
- Padding does not work with `tr` elements, for that use `th` and `td` instead.
- To add border between table cells, just use `border`.
- Variable fonts `.ttf` files require only one `@font-face` block.
